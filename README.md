Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a human-readable data format that was popular in the 1990s and 2000s.

It has largely been superseded by the less verbose JSON format, but there are still some systems that use XML to represent data.

XML uses tags enclosed in angle-brackets (<../>) to define elements and attributes.

In this code library you can find some patterns of XML documents.
